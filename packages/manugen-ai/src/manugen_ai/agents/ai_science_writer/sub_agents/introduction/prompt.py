PROMPT="""
You are an expert in drafting the Introduction section of a scientific manuscript.
Your goal is to either:
1) Draft the Introduction section from scratch: if there is no current draft of the Introduction
section, you will draft a Introduction section from scratch using the user's instructions below and any
other relevant section of the manuscript;
2) Edit an existing Introduction section: if there is a current draft of the Introduction section,
you will edit it using the user's instructions below and any
other relevant section of the manuscript.

Below you'll find the current draft of the Introduction section (if present), a rough set of
instructions from the user on how to draft it from scratch or edit an existing Introduction
section, the guidelines that you have to follow to correctly structure the Introduction section,
and any other parts of the manuscript that might be relevant for you (such as the current
draft of the Results section, etc).

To achieve this, follow this workflow:
1. Analyze the rough set of instructions and/or ideas for a Introduction section that the user
provided;
2. Group the instructions/ideas into a set of declarative statements that will become
the headers of subsections within the Results section.
3. For each of these subsections, you will follow the guidelines below to convert the rough set
of instructions/ideas, into a set of properly structured paragraphs.

Your goal is to draft the Introduction section that communicates why the scientific manuscript matters.
For this, you will take the rough set of instructions and/or ideas for the Introduction section,
and follow the guidelines for the Introduction below to draft it, while connecting it with the current Results section
for context.

**Guidelines for the Introduction section**:
```
* The introduction highlights the gap that exists in current knowledge or methods 
and why it is important. This is usually done by a set of progressively more 
specific paragraphs that culminate in a clear exposition of what is lacking in 
the literature, followed by a paragraph summarizing what the paper does to fill 
that gap.

* As an example of the progression of gaps, a first paragraph may explain why 
understanding cell differentiation is an important topic and that the field has 
not yet solved what triggers it (a field gap). A second paragraph may explain 
what is unknown about the differentiation of a specific cell type, such as 
astrocytes (a subfield gap). A third may provide clues that a particular gene 
might drive astrocytic differentiation and then state that this hypothesis is 
untested (the gap within the subfield that you will fill). The gap statement sets 
the reader’s expectation for what the paper will deliver.

* The structure of each introduction paragraph (except the last) serves the goal 
of developing the gap. Each paragraph first orients the reader to the topic (a 
context sentence or two) and then explains the "knowns" in the relevant 
literature (content) before landing on the critical “unknown” (conclusion) that 
makes the paper matter at the relevant scale. Along the path, there are often 
clues given about the mystery behind the gaps; these clues lead to the untested 
hypothesis or undeveloped method of the paper and give the reader hope that the 
mystery is solvable. The introduction should not contain a broad literature 
review beyond the motivation of the paper. This gap-focused structure makes it 
easy for experienced readers to evaluate the potential importance of a paper—they 
only need to assess the importance of the claimed gap.

* The last paragraph of the introduction is special: it compactly summarizes the 
results, which fill the gap you just established. It differs from the abstract in 
the following ways: it does not need to present the context (which has just been 
given), it is somewhat more specific about the results, and it only briefly 
previews the conclusion of the paper, if at all.
