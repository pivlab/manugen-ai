# Title
* new correlation coefficient
* transcriptomics or gene expression data

# Abstract
* add an abstract

# Introduction
* intro about correlation analysis and how important it is in the context of gene expression
* motivation about how important it is to be able to detect nonlinear patterns in expression data
* mention the maximal information coefficient (MIC) as a successful example, but that it is slow
* here we present a new algorithm: Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), which is fast and captures nonlinear patterns in gene expression data
* summary of what we did in this paper

# Results

## Overview of CCC
* brief summary of how the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) works
* add "Figure 1"
* and then explain the different panels in "Figure 1"; the figure shows synthetic data, with panels a) and b) having numerical variable pairs only, and panel c) a mix of numerical and categorical

## CCC captures nonlinear patterns in GTEx
* we compared CCC with Pearson and Spearman in GTEx
* add "Figure 2", which has the main results comparing distribution of coefficients
* add a few paragraphs explaining the differences between the three algorithms
* add "Figure 3"
* add a paragraph describing the results of Figure 3, one paragraph for panel a) and one paragraph for panel b)

# Discussion
* add discussion

# Methods
* add a more in-detail description of the CCC algorithm implemented here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/ccc/refs/heads/main/libs/ccc/coef/impl.py
