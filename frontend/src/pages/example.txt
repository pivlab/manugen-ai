# Title
A new correlation coefficient for gene expression analysis

# Keywords
* correlation analysis
* gene expression

# Abstract

# Introduction
* intro about correlation analysis and how important it is in the context of gene expression
* motivation about how important it is to be able to detect nonlinear patterns in expression data
* mention the maximal information coefficient (MIC) as a successful example, but that it is slow
* here we present a new algorithm: Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), which is fast and captures nonlinear patterns in gene expression data
* summary of what we did in this paper

# Results

## Overview of CCC
* brief summary of how CCC works; the main source code is in this file: https://github.com/greenelab/ccc/blob/main/libs/ccc/coef/impl.py
* Figure 1: include the following figure, and add a caption: https://github.com/greenelab/ccc-manuscript/blob/main/content/images/intro/relationships.svg
* then explain the different panels in the figure; itâ€™s all synthetic data, with panels a) and b) having numerical variable pairs only, and panel c) a mix of numerical and categorical

## CCC captures nonlinear patterns in GTEx
* we compared CCC with Pearson and Spearman in GTEx
* Figure 2: the main results comparing distribution of coefficients are in this figure: https://greenelab.github.io/ccc-manuscript/images/coefs_comp/gtex_whole_blood/dist-main.svg
* add a caption of Figure 2 and a few paragraphs explaining the differences between the three algorithms
* Figure 3: add the following figure and generate a caption: https://greenelab.github.io/ccc-manuscript/images/coefs_comp/gtex_whole_blood/upsetplot-main.svg
* add a paragraph describing the results of Figure 3, one paragraph for panel a) and one paragraph for panel b)
